# Tab Bar in SwiftUI on iOS/MacCatalyst?

If you need to have a Tab Bar similar (Work in Progress) to Safari here is the beginning of it.

Pull Requests are welcomeÂ â€” this is very much a work in Progress.

Replace the `DateView` obviously with your content, and use a bit more than just a `Date` in your Model. ðŸ˜‚

Because `onHover` is broken in MacCatalyst, for the moment, I'm using `onHover2`Â â€”Â Thanks [@paulcolton](https://twitter.com/paulcolton/status/1248791065651326978)!

Also you can see how `KeyCommands` are implemented for iOS & MacCatalyst, since `âŒ˜T` and `âŒ˜W` work both on iPad and Mac.

Finally, after a [very nice discussion](https://twitter.com/StuFFmc/status/1249613536625598464) with [@nhawk](https://twitter.com/nhawk) I found [this Thread on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61175725/new-tab-button-uiwindowscene-and-macos-catalyst) about the built-in `UIWindowScene` support for Tabs, which is very limited.
